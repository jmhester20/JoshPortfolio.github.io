						<h2>Planned Systems International</h2>
						<p>Technology Management Intern (May 2024  - August 2024)

							<hr />
						<p>During my Technology Management internship at Planned Systems International from May to
							August 2024,
							I integrated Microsoft Copilot into our day-to-day productivity and documentation tools.
							Turning
							manual reporting tasks into automated processes helped teams access up-to-date data
							instantly and
							cut down turnaround time significantly. I spent time talking with over forty colleagues,
							gathering
							their feedback, and making UI/UX tweaks to simplify navigation and improve their overall
							experience.
							To make sure everyone could take full advantage of these new tools, I also wrote clear user
							guides
							and documentation so future interns and team members could hit the ground running. That
							experience
							taught me the
							importance of listening closely to end-user needs and translating their feedback into
							practical
							design improvements.
							I also deepened my understanding of how AI can amplify productivity when integrated.

						<p>As a freelance PC technician since June 2024, I have assembled and configured many custom
							desktop
							systems for friends,
							family, and private clients. I carefully select components to meet the users needs ranging
							from
							high-end gaming to content creation and everyday
							productivity. I handled every step of the process, from installing Windows and Linux
							operating
							systems, drivers, and firmware to diagnosing
							hardware failures. Through this work, I gained a deep appreciation
							for system architecture, and improved my troubleshooting skills with real-world problems.

						<h2>Virginia Tech Dining Services</h2>
						<p>Dining Services Associate (August 2023 - May 2024)

						<p>

							I used a “first in, first out” system to keep all the food fresh and cut down on waste. On a
							flexible schedule of two shifts per week, I learned to jump in wherever I was needed—from
							restocking
							salad bars to running trays during peak meal times. Working alongside a team of 15-plus
							people, I
							helped maintain fast, friendly service for over 500 students a day. This role taught me the
							importance of communication, time management, and staying calm under pressure.

							<hr />
						<p>

							I worked late shifts four days a week, handling everything from restocking shelves and
							organizing
							displays to helping customers find what they needed. I learned to spot issues early, like
							low stock
							or misplaced items, and fix them on the spot. Working mostly on my own, I helped keep the
							store running
							smoothly during the busiest hours and communicated clearly with managers and teammates to
							contribute to
							everyone staying on the same page.
