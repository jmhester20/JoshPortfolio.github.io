				<h2>Planned Systems International</h2>
				<p>Technology Management Intern
					<hr />
				<p>During my Technology Management internship at Planned Systems International from May to August 2024,
					I integrated Microsoft Copilot into our day-to-day productivity and documentation tools. Turning
					manual reporting tasks into automated processes helped teams access up-to-date data instantly and
					cut down turnaround time significantly. I spent time talking with over forty colleagues, gathering
					their feedback, and making UI/UX tweaks to simplify navigation and improve their overall experience.
					To make sure everyone could take full advantage of these new tools, I also wrote clear user guides
					and documentation so future interns and team members could hit the ground running. That experience taught me the 
					importance of listening closely to end-user needs and translating their feedback into practical design improvements.
					 I also deepened my understanding of how AI can amplify productivity when  integrated.

				<h2>Freelance</h2>
				<p>PC Technician 
					<hr />
				<p>As a freelance PC technician since June 2024, I have assembled and configured many custom desktop systems for friends,
					 family, and private clients. I carefully select components to meet the users needs ranging from high-end gaming to content creation and everyday
					  productivity. I handled every step of the process, from installing Windows and Linux operating systems, drivers, and firmware to diagnosing
					   hardware failures. Through this work, I gained a deep appreciation 
					   for system architecture, and improved my troubleshooting skills with real-world problems.
