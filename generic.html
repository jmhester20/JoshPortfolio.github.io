					<h1>Personal Bio<br />
					</h1>
					<p>Virginia Tech ’25 Computer Science graduate skilled in software development, problem-solving, and
						collaboration. Experienced in building scalable software solutions and APIs with clean,
						maintainable code. Eager to join a team and contribute to impactful projects. Open to
						relocation and flexible to work on-site or remotely.</p>

				<p>I grew up in Alexandria, Virginia, but spent four years living in Germany from 4-8 years old as part of a
					military family, which taught me to embrace new experiences and enjoy different foods. In
					my free time I love gathering with friends to watch basketball, especially the Lakers, and playing some of my favorite
					video games with Batman: Arkham Knight being my all-time favorite. I’m also passionate about
					travel; I’ve already visited 14 states on my goal to see all 50.
					Whether I’m coding, exploring new places, or hanging out over games and sports, I’m driven by
					personal growth and making meaningful connections.</p>
